Hello World API Implementation


Introduction
This repository contains the implementation of a "Hello World" API using Python with Flask. It includes Swagger for API documentation, Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for scalability, and ELK (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) setup for central logging, monitoring, and visualization. Additionally, a network diagram created using Draw.io illustrates the architecture, and Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) are defined.


Features
Python Application with Flask: Implements the "Hello World" API.
Swagger for API Documentation: Provides clear documentation for API endpoints.
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA): Ensures scalability of the application.
ELK Setup for Monitoring and Visualization: Central logging with Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana for monitoring and visualization of logs.
Network Diagram: Illustrates the architecture of the solution using Draw.io.
SLOs and SLAs: Defines Service Level Objectives (SLOs) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs) for the API.


Usage
Refer to the Swagger documentation for API usage.
Use ELK setup for monitoring and visualization of logs.
Consult the network diagram to understand the architecture.
Refer to the SLOs and SLAs for performance metrics.
